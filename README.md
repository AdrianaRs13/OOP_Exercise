# OOP Exercise

This project is an exercise of shapes where I was able to practice the fundamentals of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.

## Running Tests

Use nodejs to run the test, you have to be placed in the "test" directory to run the following code line. For, simplicity I wrote the cases in the same test file.

```bash
node shapesTest.js
```

Note: If you don't have installed this package you can download it right here: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/es/).
